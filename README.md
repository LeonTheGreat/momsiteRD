title: momsite repo

description: Mom has 2 domains: ginaedwards.com (belongs to her) and ginaedwardsphd.com (belongs to me). She wants one domain to redirect to the other but I had trouble setting the redirect up in github pages (learning curve, wah) so I duplicated all the files & stuff from the momsite repo and copied it into THIS repo. Both sites are identical except for the domain, this is a temp fix while I work out the bugs and shit.
